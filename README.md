# FoundIt

**FoundIt** is a lost-and-found app designed specifically for Hunter College students and staff. It provides a simple platform to report lost and found items, helping users quickly recover their belongings without relying on posters or word-of-mouth.
This is a final project me and 3 other students did for capstone.
